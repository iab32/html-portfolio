<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello my name is Imaan Bajwa and I am currently 22 years old, I will be
  turning 23 in August 2024. A little bit about me is that I love to spend time
  with my friends and family. Growing up I love playing video games, espcially
  grew up with the PS2, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and now the PS5. I do like to code,
  and in fact I want to be able to have a career in the IT field, whether as a
  developer or as a analyst. I'm also into sports such as basketball and
  american football, my favorite teams are the New York Giants and New York
  Knicks.

  As for my academic background. I graduated in 2023 at New Jersey Institute of
  Technology or NJIT as it's known as. I went there for 4 years with a bachelor
  of science degree in Computer Science. As I mentioned in the last paragraph,
  my goal is to become a Software developer, or become a tech analyst. I do have
  interest in becoming a web developer and some of the web apps I have done as
  my projects were really fun and I enjoyed it a lot. I was able to get an IT
  internship over at Colgate-Palmolive in Piscataway, NJ. It was a good
  experience and now I'm hoping I can expand my skillset and start to gain some
  experience. I just hope that I finally be able to break that hump and start
  getting my first full time work experience, and eventually grow from that
  opportunity and get better at becoming a developer or analyst.
